# Playwright Storage State Generator for Splunk

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

[Japanese README](README.ja.md)

A tool to generate pre-authenticated browser state (Storage State) for [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/tree/main/packages/playwright-mcp) when accessing Splunk. This allows the MCP server to use a saved session instead of exposing credentials in arguments or logs.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ (LTS recommended)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kshin5/playwright-storage-state.git
cd playwright-storage-state
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

## Setup

Copy the included template and fill in your Splunk credentials (directory structure inspired by [Playwright's authentication guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth#core-concepts)).

```bash
cp playwright/.auth/splunk-myenv.env.example playwright/.auth/splunk-myenv.env
# Edit the .env file with your credentials
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```ini
SPLUNK_URL=https://your-splunk-server:8000
SPLUNK_USER=your-username
SPLUNK_PASS='your-password'
```

> **Note:** If your password contains special characters such as `#` or `$`, wrap it in single quotes (`'...'`). Without quotes, `#` is treated as the start of a comment and everything after it is ignored, causing login failures.

## Security

- The `.env` file stores passwords in **plain text**. Restrict access so only you can read it.
- Credential files in `playwright/.auth/` are excluded from git via `.gitignore`. Only the `.env.example` template is tracked.
- The generated Storage State file also contains session credentials. The script automatically restricts file permissions after saving (on Windows, verify permissions manually).

## Usage

Run from the project directory:

```bash
node generate-storage-state.js <env-file> [output-path]
```

Example:

```bash
node generate-storage-state.js playwright/.auth/splunk-myenv.env
```

> **Note for Windows users:** Both `/` and `\` work as path separators in command arguments.

- If `output-path` is omitted, it is automatically generated by replacing `.env` with `-storage.json` (e.g., `splunk-myenv.env` → `splunk-myenv-storage.json`).
- You can also specify the output path explicitly:
  ```bash
  node generate-storage-state.js playwright/.auth/splunk-myenv.env playwright/.auth/custom-output.json
  ```
- If the output directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.

### Managing multiple Splunk environments

Create separate `.env` files for each environment:

```bash
# Development
node generate-storage-state.js playwright/.auth/splunk-dev.env

# Production
node generate-storage-state.js playwright/.auth/splunk-prod.env
```

```
playwright/.auth/
├── splunk-dev.env               # Dev credentials
├── splunk-dev-storage.json      # Dev session
├── splunk-prod.env              # Prod credentials
└── splunk-prod-storage.json     # Prod session
```

Register each environment as a separate MCP server to connect to multiple Splunk instances.

## Using with Playwright MCP

Pass the generated Storage State file to the Playwright MCP server using the `--storage-state` option with an **absolute path**:

```
@playwright/mcp ... --storage-state /absolute/path/to/splunk-myenv-storage.json
```

> Use an **absolute path** for `--storage-state`. Relative paths and `~` may not be resolved correctly by the MCP server.

<details>
<summary>Example: Cursor IDE configuration</summary>

First, find the absolute path to your Storage State file:

```bash
# Run from the project directory
cd playwright-storage-state
echo "$(pwd)/playwright/.auth/splunk-myenv-storage.json"
```

Add the following to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`). The entry goes inside the `mcpServers` object. Replace the `--storage-state` value with the path from above:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright-myenv": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless",
        "--ignore-https-errors",
        "--isolated",
        "--storage-state", "/your/absolute/path/playwright-storage-state/playwright/.auth/splunk-myenv-storage.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Windows:** The `--storage-state` path works with both `/` and `\\` (e.g., `"C:/Users/..."` or `"C:\\Users\\..."`).

</details>

## Session Renewal

Splunk sessions expire after a period of time. If you encounter authentication errors, regenerate the Storage State by running the same command again.

## Limitations

- This tool targets Splunk’s **default login page** (username/password form). It does not support SSO, SAML, or custom login pages.
- Timeouts are fixed in the script: 30 seconds for the initial page load, 10 seconds for the post-login redirect. On slow networks you may need to adjust these values in the script.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to Splunk server

- Verify that `SPLUNK_URL` is correct and includes the scheme (`https://`).
- Check that the server is running and the port is accessible through any firewalls.
- For self-signed certificates, include `--ignore-https-errors` in the MCP server arguments (already included in the example above).

### Login fails

- Verify `SPLUNK_USER` and `SPLUNK_PASS` are correct.
- The script waits for a redirect to `**/app/**` after login. Timeout may indicate incorrect credentials or multi-factor authentication (MFA). Check the error message output for details.

### Certificate error (ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID)

- The script uses `ignoreHTTPSErrors: true`, so certificate errors do not affect Storage State generation.
- If you encounter certificate errors with the MCP server, add `--ignore-https-errors` to its arguments (already included in the example above).

### Timeout during login or page load

- The script uses fixed timeouts (30s for page load, 10s for post-login redirect). If you hit timeouts on a slow network, adjust the `timeout` values in the script.
